		<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
		<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Thank you for using MG3.codes. ("us", "we") These terms cover your use of services officially operated and
			provided by MG3.codes. (together, the “Services”).
		</p>
		<p>
			By using these Services, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to
			time (collectively, the "Terms"'). Please read them carefully. If you don't agree to these Terms, you may
			not use the Services.
		</p>
		<h4>Please be aware of the following:</h4>
		<p>
			You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for any contributions you make to the
			Services or their source code, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing
			any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. Although we may not
			agree with such actions, we warn users and users that authorities may seek to apply other countries'
			laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or contribute content. We generally
			cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though we hope MG3.codes and its services will continue for the foreseeable future, we reserve the right to
			suspend or end the Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.
		</p>

		<h2>II. Privacy</h2>
		<p>
			We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your
			information. Certain aspects of the Services may require you to have an account and to be logged into that
			account while you access those aspects.
		</p>
		<p>
			You agree to keep the contact information associated with your account current and complete. Your contact
			information will be used in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h4>Use by minors</h4>
		<p>
			You must be 13 years or older to use the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are at least 13 but under 16 years of age, a parent or other adult authorized by your parent may
			create an account for you to use. The account must not contain any personal data about you, and you must not
			add any personal data about yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, your parent may create an account using your parent's email address and a username that is not
			associated with you, which your parent may permit you to use to contribute map edits. For your protection,
			you are not allowed to use any social aspects of the Services, but you may be able to contribute other
			content subject to laws and regulations. You should not reveal any personal data in any communications you
			have regarding your map edits.
		</p>
		<p>
			By registering as a user or providing personal information on the Services, you represent that you are at
			least 16 years old.
		</p>

		<h2>III. Unlawful and other unauthorized uses</h2>
		<p>
			You are solely responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and third party
			agreements in your use of the Services. You represent you are not, and are not controlled by, an individual,
			organization or entity organized or located in a country or territory that is the target of sanctions
			imposed, or on any restricted or sanctioned party list maintained by the United States of America.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage or overburden the Services or interfere with
			any other party's use of the Services. You agree to abide by Mg3.codes' Usage Policies and other policies
			posted on the MG3.codes website in conjunction with the Services, including accompanying documentation.
			Those policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms.
		</p>

				Disseminate or store material that infringes the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other
				intellectual property right of any person;

				origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or genetic
				data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health,
				data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation (other than personal data about
				yourself that you contribute to your user page or other user content section, which is completely
				voluntary on your
				part and you can delete at any time), or data relating to criminal convictions and offenses or related
				security measures, and information subject to export control or economic sanction laws;
			</li>
			<li>

				intent of
				these Terms.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Additional limitations on use of personal data:</h4>
		<p>
			Through your account, you may have access to some personal data from other users. You may not use,
			store, or process any personal data available through the Services for any purpose other than:
		</p>
		<ul>

			</li>
			<li>
				As necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by you or by a third party, except
				where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
				subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
			</li>
			<li>
				Any other purpose authorized by the General Data Privacy Regulation or applicable local law(s).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Please see MG3.codes' Privacy Policy for more information.
		</p>

		<h2>IV. Use by an entity</h2>
		<p>
			If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your company or another legal entity, you represent
			that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case "you" will mean the entity you
			represent.
		</p>

		<h2>V. End users and notification</h2>
		<p>
			You may not permit your end users or other third parties to use the Services in any way that would be a
			violation of these Terms if done by you, and you agree to take reasonable efforts to prevent such use. You
			agree to promptly notify MG3.codes in writing if you become aware of any misappropriation or unauthorized
			use of the Services.
		</p>

		<h2>VI. Account cancellation or suspension</h2>
		<p>
			You are free to stop using the Services any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, we may cancel or suspend your account for violation of any policy as determined by the us. Upon
			cancellation or suspension, your right to use the Services will stop immediately. Attempting to evade a
			cancellation or suspension (such as by creating a new account or using an alternate
			account) is a violation of these Terms. You may not have access to data that you stored on the Services
			after we cancel or suspend your account. You are responsible for backing up data that you use with the
			Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will
			remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may
			still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content. In such
			circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will
			remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections I-X.
		</p>

		<h2>VII. Additional terms</h2>
		<p>
			You agree that we may freely exploit and make available any and all feedback, suggestions, ideas,
			enhancement requests, recommendations or other information you provide relating to the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that
			provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
			any remaining provisions. Headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
		</p>
		<p>
			You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
			MG3.codes as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services. You further acknowledge no confidential,
			fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created between you and MG3.codes other than
			pursuant to these Terms.
		</p>

		<h2>VIII. Disputes and jurisdiction</h2>
		<p>
			We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we
			encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the
			Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a court
			located in Washington State of The United States of America. You also agree that U.S. law will govern these
			Terms, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws
			principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the
			courts located in Washington State of The United States of America, in any legal action or proceeding
			relating to us or these Terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or
			law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our
			Services or these Terms must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1)
			year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with
			reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).
		</p>

		<h2>IX. Disclaimers</h2>
		<p>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide the Services on an "as is" and "as available"
			basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited
			to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We
			make no warranty that our Services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely,
			accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our
			directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or
			in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information,
			whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our Services creates any warranty not
			expressly stated in these Terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our Services is done at your own
			discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of
			data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or
			liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication
			maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at
			any time with or without notice.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may add, change, replace, remove, or discontinue the features and functions of the Services, including
			APIs. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to the Services are compatible
			with then-current APIs and authentication methods, and that you handle responses properly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to
			you either in part or in full depending on the law.
		</p>

		<h2>X. Limitation on liability</h2>
		<p>
			MG3.codes will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
			consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill,
			use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such
			damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand US Dollars ($1000.00) or the actual amount that
			you paid to use the Services, whichever is lesser, in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not
			allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation
			or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
			applicable law.
		</p>

		<h2>XI. Changes to Services or Terms</h2>
		<p>
			We may modify these Terms and other terms related to your use of the Services (like our Privacy Policy) from
			time to time, by posting the changed terms on the MG3.codes website. All changes will be effective
			immediately
			upon posting to the MG3.codes website unless they specify a later date. Changes will not apply
			retroactively.
			Please check these Terms periodically for changes -- your continued use of the Services after new Terms
			become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of the new Terms.
